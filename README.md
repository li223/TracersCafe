Coding Challenge - For when you need to make it painfully obvious you're not good at making things look pretty ~~even this didn't achieve that~~

This was a challenge I got given after an interview.

# Task
To create a web application in ASP.Net that allows the user to Add, Remove, Edit, and View customer information.
